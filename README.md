# ðŸ”„ For-Each Loop Examples

This Java program demonstrates the use of **for-each loops** with arrays, showcasing two examples:

1. Iterating over an array of strings to print names.
2. Iterating over an array of integers to calculate the sum.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

* Demonstrates for-each loop syntax for arrays.
* Prints all elements in a string array.
* Calculates and prints the sum of integers in an array.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)

### Steps

1. Save the code in a file named `ForEachLoop.java` inside a folder named `Expressions` (to match the package).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory above `Expressions`.
3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac Expressions/ForEachLoop.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java Expressions.ForEachLoop
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Sample Output (for `forEachLoop2` method):

```
Sum is: 15
```

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

* For-each loop (`for (type var : array)`)
* Array handling
* Basic arithmetic operations
